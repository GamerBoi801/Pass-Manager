Welcome to the ***Password Generator***! In today's digital age, having a strong and secure password is more important than ever. This project allows users to generate secure and customizable passwords based on their specific requirements. Whether you need a password for a new account, want to enhance your security, or simply wish to create unique passwords for various applications, this tool can help you create strong passwords quickly and easily!

## Why Use a Password Generator?

Creating strong passwords manually can be a daunting task. Many people resort to using simple or easily guessable passwords, which can lead to security breaches and unauthorized access to personal information. A password generator helps mitigate these risks by creating complex passwords that are difficult to crack. By using this Password Generator, you can ensure that your online accounts are protected with robust passwords that meet current security standards.

## Features

### Customizable Password Length

One of the key features of this Password Generator is its ability to customize the length of the generated passwords. You can specify the desired length based on your needs, whether you prefer shorter passwords for convenience or longer ones for enhanced security. The flexibility in password length allows you to tailor your passwords according to the requirements of different platforms.

### Character Type Options

The Password Generator provides a variety of character type options, allowing you to create highly secure passwords. You can choose whether to include:

- **Uppercase Letters (A-Z)**: Including uppercase letters adds complexity and increases the strength of your password.
- **Lowercase Letters (a-z)**: Lowercase letters are essential for creating a diverse range of possible combinations.
- **Digits (0-9)**: Incorporating numbers into your password further enhances its security.
- **Special Characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)**: Special characters are crucial for creating unpredictable passwords that are harder to guess.

### Encryption

For users who require an additional layer of security, this Password Generator offers an optional encryption feature. By encrypting your generated passwords, you can store them securely without fear of unauthorized access. This feature is particularly useful for individuals who manage multiple accounts and want to keep their credentials safe.

### User-Friendly Interface

The Password Generator is designed with user experience in mind. It features an intuitive command-line interface that provides easy-to-follow prompts guiding you through the password generation process. Even if you're not tech-savvy, you'll find it simple to navigate through the options and generate strong passwords without any hassle.

### Secure Password Generation

This tool utilizes a random selection algorithm to ensure strong and unpredictable passwords. The randomness in character selection means that each generated password is unique and not easily guessable. This feature is vital in protecting against brute-force attacks, where attackers attempt multiple combinations until they find the correct one.
