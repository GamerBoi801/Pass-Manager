# CLI Password Manager Project Outline

## 1. First Time Use
- **CLI Initialization**
  - Initializes and creates the database. ✅
  - Asks user for a master password and username on first use. ✅
  - Stores them in the database. ✅ 
- **Passwords Table**
  - Stores website name, username, and password. ✅
  - Passwords to be encrypted. ✅
- **Program Behavior**
  - Acts as a CLI program; if the user fails to provide the master password, it should quit the program. ✅

## 2. General Features   
- **Programming Language**: Python ✅
- **Database**: SQLite3 ✅
- **Libraries**: Argparse for CLI functionalities. ✅ 
- **Functionality**: Used for autofilling passwords on websites, similar to Chrome's password manager.
- **Modular Design**: all modules in the main program. 
- **Operating Systems**: Primarily for Linux and Windows.

## 3. Suggestions for Improvement

### 3.1 Enhanced Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Use a hashing algorithm to store a hashed version of the master password.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Implement optional 2FA for added security during access.
- **Encryption Standards**: Use strong encryption standards (AES-256) for stored passwords.

### 3.2 User Experience Enhancements
- **User-Friendly Prompts**: Improve CLI prompts with clear instructions and error messages.
- **Help Command**: Implement a `--help` command for detailed usage instructions and examples.
- **Configuration File**: Allow customization of settings via a configuration file.

### 3.3 Database Management
- **Backup and Restore**: Implement features for backing up the database and restoring it from backups.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Include checksums or hashes for database entries to ensure integrity.

### 3.4 Password Management Features
- **Password Generation**: Add functionality to generate strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for specific entries in the password database using keywords.
- **Categorization Tags**: Enable categorization of passwords (e.g., work, personal) for easier management.

### 3.5 Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Docker Support**: Provide a Docker container option for easier deployment across environments.
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: Ensure compatibility with WSL for Windows users. ✅ 

### 3.6 Modular Design
- **Plugin System**: Design with a plugin architecture to allow users to extend functionality. ✅ 
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Implement unit tests for each module for reliability and maintenance ease. ✅ 

### 3.7 Documentation and Community Support
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Create detailed documentation covering installation, usage, and troubleshooting.  ✅ 
- **Community Contributions**: Host the project on platforms like GitHub to encourage contributions and feedback.

### 3.8 Performance Optimization
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous programming techniques to improve performance during database operations.
- **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage when handling large datasets or multiple operations.
